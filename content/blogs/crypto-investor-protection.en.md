# Crypto Regulation: Security First

Legalization primarily aims to control this high-risk sector.

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
The law imposes strict rules (KYC) on platforms. Anonymous trading is prohibited. Every transaction must be traceable to avoid terrorism financing.

## Investor Protection
Platforms must provide financial guarantees and be transparent about risks. The law now criminalizes digital fraud and pyramid schemes linked to Blockchain. Investors will finally have legal recourse in case of fraud.
