# Moroccan Environmental Law: Regulations on Plastic Use

Morocco has emerged as a regional leader in environmental protection, implementing a robust legal framework designed to combat pollution and promote sustainable development. Central to this mission is the regulation of materials and activities that pose a significant threat to the ecosystem, particularly industrial waste and hazardous substances. While the Kingdom gained international recognition for its "Zero Mika" initiative—the ban on plastic bags—this policy is part of a much broader legal architecture governed by various codes and decrees.

Understanding the legal requirements for environmental compliance is essential for both citizens and businesses operating in Morocco. These laws do not only focus on the end-use of plastic but also on the industrial processes, waste management protocols, and environmental impact assessments required to protect the nation's natural resources.

## The Framework of Environmental Protection

The cornerstone of Morocco’s environmental policy is **Law-Framework No. 99-12**, which serves as the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development. According to **Article 26** of this law, the tasks and organization of bodies responsible for protecting and improving the environment are continuously redefined to align with modern sustainability goals.

This framework is supported by specific regulations that mandate rigorous oversight of any activity that could harm the environment. For instance, companies involved in the production or use of chemical agents, such as agricultural pesticides, must adhere to strict approval processes. Under the **Decree relating to the Approval of Agricultural Pesticides**, any product intended for the Moroccan market must undergo biological monitoring or an environmental impact study. **Article 9** of this decree specifies that even products formulated within Morocco by companies for research purposes are subject to testing in specialized laboratories to ensure they do not cause irreparable harm to the local ecology.

## Environmental Impact Assessments and Compliance

For industrial entities, compliance is not optional; it is a legal prerequisite for operation. One of the most critical tools in Moroccan law is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Under **Law No. 12-03**, which is referenced in regulations concerning quarries and industrial sites, operators must obtain a "Decision of Environmental Approval."

The consequences of failing to secure this approval are severe. According to **Article 27 of the Law on Environmental Assessment**, any person or entity operating an industrial unit or engaging in an activity subject to an environmental impact card without the required approval faces significant financial penalties. These fines range from **10,000 to 100,000 Moroccan Dirhams**.

This legal requirement ensures that before a plastic manufacturing plant or a waste processing facility begins operations, its potential impact on biodiversity, water quality, and soil health is thoroughly evaluated.

## Waste Management and the Circular Economy

Morocco’s approach to plastic and general waste is further codified in **Law No. 28-00**, which relates to waste management and disposal. This law emphasizes the importance of structured planning at the provincial and prefectural levels.

As per **Article 12 of Law 28-00**, each province or prefecture is required to establish a master plan for the management of household and similar waste. These plans must include:
*   Specific targets for waste collection and disposal rates.
*   The identification of appropriate sites for waste storage and treatment facilities.
*   A five-year and ten-year inventory of expected waste quantities based on source and nature.
*   Investment programs for the rehabilitation of unauthorized dumpsites.

This structured approach is vital for managing plastic pollution. By integrating waste management into urban planning and requiring specialized facilities for treatment and "valorization" (the process of turning waste into energy or new materials), Morocco aims to transition toward a circular economy where plastic waste is minimized and managed effectively.

## Specialized Regulations for Hazardous Materials

Beyond standard plastic and household waste, Moroccan law provides specific oversight for hazardous materials that could interact with the environment. **Law No. 142.12** establishes the Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security, which oversees the transport of dangerous goods. 

**Article 2** of this law stipulates that the transport of radioactive and hazardous materials must comply with international agreements published in the Official Gazette. In cases of ambiguity, the stringent technical regulations of the Agency prevail. This level of oversight ensures that industrial activities—including those that may use specialized plastic polymers in high-tech or medical fields—do not lead to environmental catastrophes.

Furthermore, the regulation of explosive materials and pyrotechnics under **Reference 6** limits the manufacture and import of such materials to Moroccan companies that have received specific authorization under **Articles 2 and 27** of the relevant law. This prevents the unregulated disposal of hazardous chemical components into the environment.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Morocco’s environmental legal landscape is a comprehensive system designed to balance industrial growth with ecological preservation. While specific bans on single-use plastics often capture the headlines, the underlying strength of the law lies in its procedural requirements—from environmental impact studies to provincial waste management plans.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Mandatory Approvals:** No industrial activity with a potential environmental impact can proceed without a formal Decision of Environmental Approval.
*   **Strict Penalties:** Operating without environmental clearance can result in fines up to 100,000 MAD.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Waste management is decentralized to the provincial level, requiring long-term planning for collection and disposal.
*   **Integrated Oversight:** Agricultural, industrial, and hazardous materials are all governed by specific decrees that prioritize environmental safety and biological monitoring.

By adhering to these regulations, businesses and individuals contribute to the Kingdom's goal of sustainable development, ensuring that Morocco's natural heritage is protected for future generations.
