# Moroccan Law on Medical Liability

The Moroccan healthcare system has undergone significant legislative transformations in recent years. As the Kingdom seeks to modernise its health infrastructure and attract international expertise, the legal framework governing medical liability has become a cornerstone of patient rights and professional accountability. Understanding the nuances of medical liability is essential for both healthcare providers and patients to navigate the complexities of medical errors and professional negligence.

In Morocco, medical liability is not governed by a single "Medical Liability Code" but is instead derived from a combination of the Dahir of Obligations and Contracts (DOC), the Penal Code, and specific sectoral laws such as Law No. 131.13 relating to the practice of medicine.

## The Legal Basis of Medical Liability in Morocco

Medical liability in Morocco arises when a healthcare professional fails to meet the required standard of care, resulting in harm to a patient. Under Moroccan law, the relationship between a doctor and a patient is generally viewed as a contractual one, though it can also fall under tort law (delictual liability) in specific circumstances.

The practice of medicine is strictly regulated. According to **Law No. 131.13**, and supported by **Reference 7 (Law on the National Order of Physicians)**, all doctors practicing in Morocco—whether in the public sector, private sector, or university hospitals—must be registered with the National Order of Physicians (L'Ordre National des Médecins). This institution, as per **Article 2 of Reference 7**, is responsible for ensuring that doctors adhere to the principles of integrity, competence, and the "traditions of honor" inherent to the profession.

Liability is typically categorised into three types:
1.  **Civil Liability:** Aimed at compensating the victim for damages caused by negligence or error.
2.  **Disciplinary Liability:** Managed by the National Order of Physicians, focusing on breaches of professional ethics.
3.  **Criminal Liability:** Triggered in cases of involuntary homicide or unintended physical harm caused by gross negligence.

## Defining Medical Errors and Negligence

A medical error occurs when a practitioner deviates from the established "state of the art" or the standard practices recognised by the medical community at the time of treatment. It is important to distinguish between an "error" and a "complication."

Under Moroccan jurisprudence, a doctor’s obligation is generally one of **means**, not of **result**. This means a doctor does not guarantee a cure but guarantees to deploy all necessary efforts, knowledge, and diligence consistent with current medical science. However, in specific cases—such as plastic surgery for non-therapeutic reasons or certain laboratory analyses—the obligation may shift toward a "result," making liability easier to establish.

To prove negligence, a claimant must demonstrate three elements:
*   **The Fault:** A specific error in diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up.
*   **The Damage:** Physical, psychological, or financial harm suffered by the patient.
*   **The Causal Link:** A direct connection proving that the fault specifically caused the damage.

## Foreign Practitioners and Temporary Medical Missions

With the introduction of **Framework Law No. 06.22** (referenced in **Reference 2**), Morocco is actively encouraging the "attraction of Moroccan competencies abroad and foreign expertise." This opening of the medical sector brings specific liability considerations for non-resident doctors.

According to **Reference 6 (Decree implementing Law 131.13)**, foreign or non-resident doctors practicing temporarily in Morocco must meet strict criteria. **Article 9** of this decree stipulates that any public or private facility intending to involve a non-resident doctor must submit a reasoned request to the Ministry of Health. Crucially, the application must include:
*   A copy of a diploma qualifying the individual as a specialist.
*   Proof of registration in the medical order of their country of residence.
*   **A copy of an insurance contract** specifically covering the doctor's civil liability for medical acts performed within Morocco.

This mandatory insurance ensures that even if a practitioner is not a permanent resident, the patient remains protected and has a clear path to compensation in the event of a medical error.

## Institutional Oversight and Patient Protection

The Moroccan state, through **Article 13 of the Framework Law (Reference 2)**, commits to the continuous rehabilitation of health infrastructure to ensure the quality of care. Furthermore, **Reference 8** outlines the creation of a committee to monitor the practice of medicine by foreigners, ensuring that quality standards are maintained regardless of the practitioner's origin.

In the public sector, the state is generally liable for errors committed by its agents (doctors in public hospitals) under the principles of administrative law. However, if the error is "detachable" from the service—meaning it was a personal, gross, or intentional fault—the doctor may be held personally liable.

In the private sector, the practitioner or the clinic is directly liable. The recent **Decree of September 2024 (Reference 4)** also highlights the increasing regulation of the pharmaceutical and medical supply chain, ensuring that liability extends to the quality of products and equipment used in medical procedures.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Medical liability in Morocco is a balancing act between protecting patient rights and allowing medical professionals to exercise their expertise without the fear of frivolous litigation. The legal landscape is shifting toward greater transparency and stricter insurance requirements, especially for international practitioners.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Obligation of Means:** Doctors are generally required to provide diligent care rather than a guaranteed cure.
*   **Mandatory Insurance:** Professional civil liability insurance is a prerequisite for practice, particularly for foreign and non-resident doctors under **Article 9 of the Decree on Law 131.13**.
*   **National Order Oversight:** The National Order of Physicians (L'Ordre National des Médecins) plays a vital role in maintaining ethical standards and presiding over disciplinary matters.
*   **Legal Integration:** Framework Law No. 06.22 aims to improve the quality of the health system by integrating foreign expertise while maintaining strict legal oversight through committees and ministerial authorisations.
