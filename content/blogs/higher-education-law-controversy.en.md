# Moroccan University at Boiling Point

Law 59.24 on higher education has sparked widespread controversy. The ministry aims to align university training with labor market needs, but unions see it as an infringement on university independence.

## Points of Friction
- **Promotion**: Linking promotion to scientific production and patents rather than just seniority.
- **Contracting**: Possibility of recruiting private sector experts, seen as a threat to tenured positions.
- **Governance**: Reducing teacher representation in councils in favor of the socio-economic sector.

The government insists on improving international rankings, while teachers defend university democratization.
