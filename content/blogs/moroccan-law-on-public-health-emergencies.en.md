# Moroccan Law on Public Health Emergencies

The evolution of the Moroccan legal landscape regarding public health has undergone significant transformation in recent years. Historically rooted in foundational texts, the system has moved toward a more integrated approach that combines universal health coverage, professional regulation, and administrative agility. Understanding these laws is essential for citizens, residents, and healthcare professionals to navigate their rights and obligations within the Kingdom.

In Morocco, the legal framework for health is not contained in a single "emergency" code but is rather a sophisticated network of laws, decrees, and framework acts. These laws define how the state manages health crises, ensures the continuity of care, and regulates the medical profession to maintain high standards of public safety.

## The Foundation of Universal Health Coverage and Mandatory Insurance

At the heart of Morocco’s public health strategy is the principle of collective and mutual responsibility for health expenses. This is codified in **Law No. 65.00**, which serves as the Basic Healthcare Coverage Code (recently amended by **Law No. 27.22**).

The preamble of this law emphasizes that the right to health is a fundamental human right, as recognized by international conventions. To manifest this right, the Moroccan legislator established the **Mandatory Basic Health Insurance (AMO)**. This system is designed to be inclusive, gradually expanding to cover all social categories.

Key legal provisions under Law No. 65.00 include:
*   **Mandatory Enrollment:** Article 128 mandates that compliance with basic health insurance is verified by legally appointed agents.
*   **Employer Obligations:** Under Article 130, any employer who fails to enroll in the relevant management body within legal deadlines faces fines ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 MAD. Furthermore, Article 131 imposes a fine of 1,000 MAD per employee for failure to register staff.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Article 129 provides a legal safeguard for beneficiaries. If a claim for reimbursement or a refund of contributions is denied, the individual has a one-year period from the date of notification to appeal the decision.

## Structural Reforms and the National Health System

To manage health emergencies and everyday care effectively, the Moroccan government enacted **Framework Law No. 06.22** regarding the national health system. This law focuses on the "care pathway," which organizes how patients interact with the medical system.

According to **Article 13** of this framework law, the state is committed to the continuous rehabilitation of health infrastructure to improve the supply of treatments in the public sector. A critical component of this reform is the organization of the patient journey:
1.  **Public Sector:** Patients must first pass through primary healthcare institutions.
2.  **Private Sector:** Patients must first consult a general practitioner before escalating to specialized care.

Furthermore, **Article 14** addresses the need for expertise during health crises or for general system development. The law empowers the state to attract Moroccan talents living abroad, as well as foreign experts and investments. This "transfer of expertise" is vital for enhancing the quality of health services and ensuring the system can respond to modern medical challenges.

## Regulation of Medical Products and Professional Standards

Public health safety is also maintained through strict regulation of pharmaceutical products and medical qualifications. Recent administrative updates, such as the **Decree of September 2024 (26 Rabi' al-Awwal 1446)**, signed by the Head of Government, Aziz Akhannouch, and the Minister of Health and Social Protection, Khalid Ait Taleb, outline the procedures for obtaining certificates for the packaging and marketing of medical batches.

Until the full implementation of Law No. 10.22, the **Directorate of Medicines and Pharmacy (DMP)** remains the central authority where files for marketing authorization must be deposited and studied.

Regarding the practitioners themselves, **Royal Decree (Dahir) No. 46.66** (as a law) remains a foundational text for the status of "Specialist" and "Professor" physicians. By regulating who can claim these titles and under what conditions, the law ensures that in times of a pandemic or health emergency, the public is treated by qualified personnel who are subject to the oversight of the **Medical Council (Ordre des Médecins)**.

## Fiscal Obligations for Residents Returning to Morocco

While not strictly a medical law, **Law No. 63.23** (regarding assets held abroad by Moroccans changing their tax residence to Morocco) has practical implications for the broader social protection project. As Morocco moves toward a "Welfare State" model, the integration of all citizens into the domestic tax and social security system is a priority.

Under **Article 6**, Moroccans returning to the Kingdom must declare their foreign assets to the **Office des Changes** within one year of the law's publication. This ensures that the funding for national projects, including the massive expansion of the healthcare system, is supported by a transparent and comprehensive tax base.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

The Moroccan legal framework for health is built on the pillars of mandatory participation, professional excellence, and administrative oversight. Whether through the enforcement of insurance enrollment or the strict certification of medicines, the law aims to protect the population’s well-being.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Mandatory Insurance:** Participation in the AMO system is a legal requirement for employers and employees, with significant fines for non-compliance.
*   **Structured Care:** The "care pathway" starting with primary care or general practitioners is now the legal standard for accessing the health system.
*   **Institutional Oversight:** The Ministry of Health and the Directorate of Medicines and Pharmacy play central roles in authorizing treatments and managing the medical supply chain.
*   **Professional Standards:** Only doctors meeting specific legal criteria under Royal Decrees can practice as specialists, ensuring patient safety during emergencies.
