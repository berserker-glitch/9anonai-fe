# Civil Procedure Revolution: Project 02.23

The Code of Civil Procedure is the "litigant's constitution". Its new amendments primarily aim for judicial efficiency and reducing case processing times.

## Major Novelties
1. **Digitalization**: Adoption of electronic notification as an official mechanism, ending "failure to notify" issues that stalled cases for years.
2. **Fighting Abuse**: The judge can now fine parties who abuse their right to litigate for delaying purposes.
3. **Strict Deadlines**: Setting rigorous deadlines for pronouncing judgments.

This law is a decisive step towards a "court of tomorrow", fast and efficient.
