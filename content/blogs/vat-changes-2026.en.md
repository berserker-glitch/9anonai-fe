# VAT 2026: The Neutrality Reform

Value Added Tax (VAT) is one of the most complex taxes in the Moroccan fiscal system. The 2026 reform aims to simplify this system and reduce the "buffer" (non-recoverable VAT credit).

## What Goes Down (or Disappears)
- **Pharmaceutical Products**: Total exemption (0% VAT) to reduce healthcare costs.
- **School Supplies**: Integration into the list of exempt products to support families.

## What Goes Up
- **Water and Electricity**: Progressive harmonization of rates to eventually reach a single rate, which could slightly impact the bills of high-consumption households.

## VAT Refund
The VAT refund procedure for companies has been accelerated, with a commitment from the State to reduce processing times to less than 3 months for "compliant" companies.
