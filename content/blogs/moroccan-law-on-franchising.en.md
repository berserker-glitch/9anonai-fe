# Navigating the Legal Landscape of Franchising in Morocco

Franchising has become a cornerstone of the Moroccan economy, driving growth in sectors ranging from fast food and apparel to high-end hospitality and industrial services. For international franchisors looking to expand into North Africa and local entrepreneurs (franchisees) seeking proven business models, Morocco offers a sophisticated, albeit complex, legal environment.

While Morocco does not currently have a single, unified "Franchise Act," the regulatory framework for franchising is built upon a combination of the Code of Obligations and Contracts, the Commercial Code, and specific laws governing competition, intellectual property, and financial transfers. Understanding these intersecting laws is crucial for drafting enforceable agreements and ensuring operational compliance.

## The Foundation: Contractual Freedom and Commercial Law

In the absence of a specific franchising statute, the legal relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee is primarily governed by the principle of "freedom of contract." However, this freedom is framed by the Moroccan Code of Obligations and Contracts (Dahir des Obligations et des Contrats).

A franchise agreement in Morocco is viewed as a complex commercial contract that involves the transfer of know-how, the licensing of intellectual property, and ongoing technical assistance. Under **Law 17.97 relating to the Protection of Industrial Property**, as managed by the **Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC)** (Reference 3), any trademark licensing included in a franchise deal must be clearly defined. To be opposable to third parties, these licenses should be registered with OMPIC to ensure the franchisee’s right to use the brand is legally recognized.

Furthermore, **Law 104.12 on the Freedom of Prices and Competition** (Reference 8) plays a vital role. Article 1 of this law stipulates that its provisions apply to all natural or legal persons, regardless of whether they have a permanent headquarters in Morocco, provided their actions affect competition within the Moroccan market. Franchisors must be careful that exclusivity clauses or price-fixing mechanisms do not violate Moroccan competition standards.

## Intellectual Property and Quality Standards

A primary component of franchising is the protection of the brand’s creative and industrial assets. Moroccan law provides robust protections for these elements:

1.  **Copyright and Artistic Works**: According to the **Law relating to Copyright and Neighboring Rights** (Reference 1), protection extends to architectural designs and fine arts integrated into buildings within the Kingdom. This is particularly relevant for franchises where the "store concept" or specific interior design is a protected element of the brand identity.
2.  **Standardization and Compliance**: Under **Law 12.06 regarding Standardization, Certification, and Accreditation** (Reference 7), certain products or services may be subject to mandatory Moroccan standards (NM). Article 33 allows the government to make specific standards compulsory. Franchisees must ensure that the goods provided by the franchisor meet these local technical specifications and safety requirements.

## Financial Regulations and External Trade

For international franchising, the movement of funds is a critical legal consideration. Moroccan foreign exchange regulations, overseen by the **Office des Changes**, dictate how royalties, entry fees, and sourcing payments are sent abroad.

**Law 19.06** (Reference 4) governs statistical declarations for external trade and the balance of payments. Article 1 of this law applies to all commercial and financial operations between residents (the Moroccan franchisee) and non-residents (the foreign franchisor). It is mandatory to declare these transactions to ensure compliance with the "Global External Financial Position of Morocco." Failure to structure the franchise agreement in alignment with these foreign exchange rules can lead to significant delays in repatriating profits or paying royalty fees.

## Market Integrity and Dispute Resolution

The Moroccan legal system has evolved to ensure transparency and equity in commercial dealings. The **Moroccan Capital Market Authority (AMMC)**, governed by **Law 43.12** (Reference 2), emphasizes principles of "fairness, transparency, and market integrity." While this law primarily targets capital markets, the underlying legal philosophy in Morocco increasingly demands "prioritization of the client's interests" and the avoidance of conflicts of interest in professional relationships.

If a dispute arises, the parties typically turn to the Moroccan Commercial Courts. However, many franchise agreements include arbitration clauses. Morocco is a signatory to the New York Convention, making international arbitration awards generally enforceable, provided they do not conflict with Moroccan public policy (ordre public).

## Key Takeaways for Franchising in Morocco

*   **Registration is Key**: Always register trademarks and patents with OMPIC (Reference 3) to protect the core assets of the franchise.
*   **Competition Compliance**: Ensure that exclusivity and territorial clauses do not fall foul of the **Law on Freedom of Prices and Competition** (Reference 8).
*   **Exchange Control**: International franchisors must ensure their contracts are compatible with the **Office des Changes** regulations regarding the transfer of royalties and fees (Reference 4).
*   **Local Standards**: Verify if the franchised products require specific Moroccan certifications or must adhere to mandatory standards under **Law 12.06** (Reference 7).

By navigating these specific legal references, both franchisors and franchisees can build a stable and profitable partnership within the Moroccan market.
