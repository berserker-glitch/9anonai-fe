# Tenant Rights in Morocco: How to Protect Yourself from Rental Disputes

Navigating the real estate market in a foreign country or even within your own can be a complex endeavor. Understanding **tenant rights Morocco** is essential for anyone looking to rent residential or commercial property in the Kingdom. Whether you are a local resident or an expatriate, knowing the legal framework helps prevent a common **litige locatif Maroc** (rental dispute) and ensures a harmonious relationship between the landlord and the tenant.

Moroccan rental law is designed to balance the interests of both parties, but tenants often find themselves at a disadvantage if they are unaware of the specific protections offered by the Civil Code and specialized rental laws. This guide explores the essential legal aspects of renting and provides practical advice on how to handle conflicts.

## Understanding the Legal Framework of Rental Agreements

In Morocco, rental relationships are primarily governed by Law No. 67-12, which manages the relationship between landlords and tenants of buildings for residential or professional use. This law outlines the obligations of each party and provides the mechanisms for dispute resolution.

When entering into a lease, it is vital to have a written contract. While oral agreements were common in the past, a written document is now the standard for protecting **tenant rights Morocco**. This document should clearly state the rental amount, the payment date, the duration of the lease, and the condition of the premises.

### The Importance of the Inventory of Fixtures
Before moving in, always conduct a "state of play" or inventory of fixtures (Etat des lieux). Under Moroccan law, if no inventory is conducted, the tenant is presumed to have received the premises in good condition. To avoid a future **litige locatif Maroc** regarding the security deposit, ensure every crack, leak, or malfunction is documented and signed by both parties.

## Key Protections: حقوق المستأجر في المغرب

The concept of **حقوق المستأجر في المغرب** (tenant rights in Morocco) covers several critical areas, ranging from the enjoyment of the property to protection against arbitrary eviction.

### 1. Right to a Habitable Property
The landlord is legally obligated to deliver the property in a state that allows for its intended use. This means the structural integrity, water, and electricity systems must be functional. If the property requires major repairs that are the responsibility of the landlord, the tenant has the right to demand these repairs be completed.

### 2. Protection Against Unjustified Rent Increases
Rent increases are not arbitrary in Morocco. Law No. 07-03 governs the revision of rents. Generally, rent cannot be increased before a period of three years has passed since the start of the lease or the last increase. The increase is typically capped (usually 8% for residential properties and 10% for commercial properties), unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract.

### 3. Security of Tenure and Eviction Rules
A landlord cannot simply evict a tenant without a valid legal reason. Valid reasons include:
*   Non-payment of rent.
*   Using the property for illegal purposes or purposes not specified in the lease.
*   The landlord’s need to occupy the property personally (subject to specific conditions and notice periods).
*   The need to demolish and rebuild the property.

In most cases, a formal notice must be served through a judicial bailiff, granting the tenant a specific period to rectify the situation or vacate.

## Dealing with Expropriation and Public Interest

While most disputes happen between individuals, sometimes the state intervenes. According to the Law relating to Expropriation for Public Utility (القانون المتعلق بنزع الملكية لأجل المنفعة العامة), the state can reclaim property for public projects.

As noted in Article 1 and 2 of this law, expropriation can only occur if "public utility" is declared and must be sanctioned by a judicial ruling. For a tenant, this means that if the building you occupy is marked for expropriation, you are entitled to compensation for the loss of use and the costs of moving. This is a specialized area of **tenant rights Morocco** where legal counsel is often required.

## How to File Complaint in Morocco for Rental Issues

If you find yourself in a situation where your rights are being violated, you must know **how to file complaint in Morocco**. Legal disputes regarding rentals are generally handled by the First Instance Courts (Tribunal de Première Instance) or, in some cases involving administrative bodies, the Administrative Courts.

### Step 1: Formal Notice (Mise en Demeure)
Before going to court, it is mandatory (and practical) to send a formal notice through a judicial bailiff (Huissier de Justice). This document officially notifies the landlord of the breach (e.g., failure to repair or illegal rent increase) and gives them a deadline to resolve the issue.

### Step 2: Mediation
Many rental disputes in Morocco are settled through informal mediation. However, if this fails, the next step is the judicial route.

### Step 3: Filing the Lawsuit
To initiate a **litige locatif Maroc** case, you must submit a written petition to the court. You will need:
*   A copy of the lease agreement.
*   Proof of rent payments (receipts).
*   The formal notice previously served.
*   Any evidence of the dispute (photos, expert reports).

## Commercial vs. Residential Rights

It is important to distinguish between residential and commercial leases. For those looking to practice commerce, the Moroccan Commercial Code (مدونة التجارة) provides specific protections. For instance, Article 15 and 16 mention that foreigners have the full capacity to engage in trade in Morocco upon reaching 18 years of age.

For commercial tenants, the "Right to Lease" (Droit au bail) is a significant asset. After two years of continuous occupation, a commercial tenant gains the right to renew their lease indefinitely, and the landlord can only refuse renewal by paying a significant eviction indemnity.
