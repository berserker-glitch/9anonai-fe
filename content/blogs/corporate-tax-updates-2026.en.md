# Corporate Tax in 2026: Towards Unification

The year 2026 marks a decisive step in the implementation of the "Framework Law on Tax Reform". The goal is clear: to converge towards unified rates by 2027.

## New Tiers
1. **Industrial Acceleration Zones**: The preferential rate is progressively raised to reach 20% eventually, ending tax advantages deemed "harmful" by the EU.
2. **SMEs and VSEs**: The 20% rate becomes the standard, replacing the old progressive scale that created threshold effects.

## Digitalization
From now on, **all** tax declarations must be made electronically. The General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) no longer accepts physical filings, under penalty of surcharges.
