# Mother's Remarriage and Children's Fate

The automatic loss of custody by the mother upon remarriage has long been a nightmare for divorced women, often penalizing children deprived of emotional stability.

## Child's Interest First
New proposals place the "best interest of the child" as the unique criteria.
- Trend towards non-automatic forfeiture of custody in case of remarriage, leaving the judge with discretion.
- Focus on the custodian's capacity to offer a healthy environment.

This flexibility aims to ensure the child's psychological and material stability, far from conflicts between ex-spouses.
