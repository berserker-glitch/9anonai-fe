# Organizing the Right to Strike: The Difficult Equation

The organic law on strikes remains one of the most controversial. While the Constitution guarantees this right, employers deem its regulation necessary for public service continuity and freedom of work.

## Points of Contention
- **Notice**: Obligation to inform employer and authorities before the strike begins.
- **Minimum Service**: Obligation for vital sectors (health, transport) to ensure minimum service.
- **Work Obstruction**: Prohibition of preventing non-strikers from working.

Unions consider some conditions "prohibitive", while the government and employers insist on protecting the economy.
