# Rationalizing Spending

The government continues to merge or dissolve inefficient public entities.

## Example: Medicinal Plants Agency
Its attributions are transferred to the University to:
- Link research directly to academia.
- Reduce administrative costs (director salaries, HQs...).

An "intelligent austerity" policy to improve public sector improved performance.
