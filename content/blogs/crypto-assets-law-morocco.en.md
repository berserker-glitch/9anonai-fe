# End of Ban: Morocco Enters Crypto Era

After years of strict "ban", Morocco finally unveils Draft Law 42.25 on crypto-assets. A response to economic reality, as Moroccans are among the biggest users in Africa.

## What Does the Law Say?
It does not recognize Bitcoin as "legal tender" for daily payments, but regulates it as "digital financial assets" that can be invested in and traded via licensed platforms.

## Role of Bank Al-Maghrib
The Central Bank and AMMC will supervise platforms and issue licenses. Investors will finally be able to use official banking channels instead of the black market (P2P).
