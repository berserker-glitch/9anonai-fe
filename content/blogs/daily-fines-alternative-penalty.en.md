# The Daily Fine: When Money Replaces the Cell

The "daily fine" is one of the innovative solutions of the alternative sentencing law to replace short prison sentences, whose negative effects often outweigh the deterrent effect.

## Calculation
The judge sets a sum of money for each day of the pronounced prison sentence.
- **Minimum**: 100 DH per day.
- **Maximum**: 2000 DH per day.

The amount is set according to the convict's financial capabilities, ensuring a deterrent but realistic penalty.

## Objectives
- Avoid mixing petty criminals with dangerous ones.
- Generate revenue for the State to improve the justice system.
- Preserve the convict's professional life.

Note that this alternative is excluded in cases of recidivism or serious crimes.
