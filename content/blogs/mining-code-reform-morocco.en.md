## Mining Code Reform in Morocco: Navigating the Legal Landscape of Natural Resources

Morocco’s strategic position as a gateway to Africa and its vast geological potential have long made the mining sector a cornerstone of the national economy. From phosphates to precious metals and industrial minerals, the management of natural resources is governed by a sophisticated legal framework designed to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability and administrative oversight.

The evolution of the Moroccan mining and industrial code reflects a transition toward modern governance, aiming to attract international investment while ensuring that the state maintains rigorous control over its strategic assets. Understanding these regulations is essential for investors, legal practitioners, and stakeholders operating within the Kingdom’s industrial sphere.

## The Role of the National School of Mineral Industry (ENIM)

A critical component of Morocco’s mining infrastructure is the development of human capital. The legal framework establishes specialized institutions to ensure that the technical management of mineral resources is handled by qualified experts. Central to this is the National School of the Mineral Industry (ENIM).

According to **Decree No. 2.92.998** and related regulatory texts, such as those issued in October 1989 and October 1993, the school operates under strict administrative guidelines. **Article 31** of the 1989 Decree specifically opens the door for international cooperation, stating that foreign candidates accepted by the Moroccan government may prepare for and receive diplomas from the school under the same conditions as Moroccan students.

This inclusivity, reaffirmed in **Article 29** of the 1993 Decree, ensures that the mining sector benefits from a diverse, highly trained workforce capable of implementing modern extraction and processing technologies. The execution of these educational standards is a cross-ministerial effort involving the Minister in charge of Mines and the Minister of Finance, highlighting the strategic importance of mining education to the national budget and industrial policy.

## Industrial Property and Commercial Oversight

For investors in the mining and industrial sectors, protecting intellectual property and navigating commercial registration is paramount. The Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC) serves as the primary regulator in this regard.

The legal basis for this oversight is found in **Law No. 13.99**, which establishes the office's mandate. Under **Article 1** of this law (as amended by **Law No. 87.17** and implemented by **Dahir No. 1.18.79** in August 2018), the office is placed under the guardianship of the government authority in charge of Trade and Industry. This ensures that mining patents, industrial designs, and commercial trademarks related to mineral processing are protected under a unified legal umbrella, providing the legal certainty required for large-scale capital investment.

## Environmental Compliance and Strategic Infrastructure

Modern mining reform in Morocco cannot be discussed without addressing environmental protection and large-scale infrastructure projects. The Kingdom has integrated environmental impact assessments into its industrial licensing processes to align with international standards.

### Environmental Impact and Penalties
Under **Article 27** of the **Law on Environmental Assessment**, the law imposes strict penalties for non-compliance. Any entity operating an industrial unit or engaging in activities subject to an environmental impact study without obtaining a formal "Environmental Approval Decision" faces fines ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 dirhams. Furthermore, **Decree No. 2.08.243** created a specialized committee for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), demonstrating Morocco’s commitment to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which the Kingdom ratified in 2004.

### Strategic Energy Infrastructure
The mining sector is often linked to the energy sector, particularly regarding the transport of natural resources. **Decree No. 2.92.998** (April 1993) authorized the National Petroleum Products Company (SNPP) to contribute to the capital of companies focused on the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline. This decree was based on **Article 8 of Law No. 39.89**, which governs the transfer of public enterprises to the private sector. Such laws illustrate the flexibility of the Moroccan legal system in facilitating public-private partnerships for large-scale resource infrastructure.

## Import Controls and Industrial Protection

To support local industry and manage the flow of materials, the Moroccan government occasionally exercises its right to implement temporary import restrictions. **Decree No. 2.70.239**, rooted in **Article 101 of the 1970 Constitution**, provides a historical and legal precedent for the suspension of imports of certain parts or materials used in the automotive and industrial sectors.

Under **Article 1** of this decree, specific items—ranging from agricultural tractors to transport vehicles—may have their entry into Morocco temporarily suspended unless a specific permit is issued by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry. This allows the state to protect domestic mineral-related industries and manage the trade balance during periods of economic transition.

## Conclusion: Key Takeaways

The Moroccan legal framework governing mining and natural resources is a multi-layered system that emphasizes:

1.  **Professional Excellence:** Through institutions like ENIM, ensuring both domestic and foreign experts are trained to rigorous standards.
2.  **Institutional Stability:** With OMPIC providing a secure legal environment for commercial and industrial property rights.
3.  **Environmental Responsibility:** Enforcing strict financial penalties for projects that bypass environmental impact assessments.
4.  **Strategic Sovereignty:** Maintaining the ability to regulate imports and oversee major infrastructure projects like the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline.

For those looking to invest in Morocco’s natural resources, success depends on navigating these specific decrees and laws, ensuring that technical operations are matched by rigorous legal compliance.
