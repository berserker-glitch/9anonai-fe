# The Price of Digitalization

Facing growing demand (Criminal Record, Commercial Register), the government introduces fees for certain online services.

## Philosophy
These symbolic fees aim to cover platform maintenance. Remote service saves the citizen travel costs far exceeding the fee.

## Free Justice
The principle of free justice remains for the indigent and access to the judge. These fees concern only complementary administrative comfort services.
