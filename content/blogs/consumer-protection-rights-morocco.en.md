# Consumer Protection Rights Under Moroccan Law

Navigating the marketplace as a consumer requires more than just a keen eye for quality; it requires a fundamental understanding of your legal rights. In the Kingdom of Morocco, the legal framework has evolved significantly to balance the relationship between professional suppliers and individual consumers. This balance is primarily maintained through a robust set of laws designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability.

Whether you are purchasing household goods, engaging in e-commerce, or entering into service contracts, Moroccan law provides specific protections against unfair practices and defective products. This article explores the essential pillars of consumer protection in Morocco, drawing from the Code of Obligations and Contracts and Law No. 31-08, which establishes measures for consumer protection.

## The Foundation of Consumer Rights: Law 31-08

Law No. 31-08 serves as the cornerstone of consumer advocacy in Morocco. As outlined in Article 1, the primary objectives of this legislation are to provide consumers with clear and appropriate information regarding products and services, protect them against abusive clauses in contracts, and establish legal warranties for defects.

One of the most critical aspects of this law is the definition of the relationship between the "Supplier" (the professional) and the "Consumer" (the individual). Under Article 2, the law explicitly governs these interactions to ensure that the consumer is not at a disadvantage due to a lack of professional expertise. Furthermore, Article 19 declares that any "abusive clause"—a term in a contract that creates a significant imbalance between the rights and obligations of the parties to the detriment of the consumer—is considered null and void.

## Warranties and Protection Against Defects

When you purchase a product in Morocco, you are protected by both legal and contractual warranties. Under the traditional Moroccan Code of Obligations and Contracts (Dahir des Obligations et des Contrats - DOC), sellers are generally responsible for "hidden defects" (vices cachés).

However, Law 31-08 significantly strengthens these protections for modern commerce. Key points include:

*   **The Legal Warranty:** Article 65 of Law 31-08 modifies the traditional rules found in the DOC. Specifically, it stipulates that the provisions of Article 571 of the DOC—which allow a seller to stipulate they are not responsible for any warranty—cannot be applied to consumer contracts. In simpler terms, a professional supplier in Morocco cannot "contract out" of their legal obligation to provide a functional, non-defective product.
*   **Post-Sale Services:** The law mandates that suppliers provide clear information regarding after-sales services and the availability of spare parts (Article 1).
*   **Industrial Property Protection:** For innovators and businesses, Law 17-97 provides a framework for protecting industrial designs and inventions. Articles 75 and 76 of the associated decree allow exhibitors at official international fairs in Morocco to obtain "guarantee certificates" to protect their intellectual property temporarily while products are on display.

## Transparency in E-Commerce and Distance Selling

With the rise of digital trade, Moroccan law has adapted to protect consumers who purchase goods remotely. Article 4-1 of the DOC (as amended) and Article 31 of Law 31-08 impose strict transparency requirements on professional electronic suppliers.

When a supplier offers goods or services via the internet or telephone, they must:
1.  Make contractual terms available in a way that allows the consumer to store and reproduce them.
2.  Clearly state their identity and the commercial purpose of the contact at the beginning of any conversation (especially in telephone sales).
3.  Remain bound by the offer for as long as it is accessible electronically, unless a specific duration was previously stated.

These measures are designed to prevent "trap" subscriptions and ensure that the consumer provides informed consent before a transaction is finalised.

## Legal Recourse and Dispute Resolution

If a dispute arises, Moroccan law provides several avenues for redress. Consumers have the right to seek compensation for damages caused by defective products or unfair practices. 

In terms of judicial procedure:
*   **Jurisdiction:** According to the Code of Civil Procedure and Law 53-95, commercial disputes are generally handled by Commercial Courts. However, Article 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure ensures that incidental claims and warranty demands are heard by the court already handling the original case to streamline the process.
*   **Burden of Proof:** In cases involving potentially abusive clauses, Article 18 of Law 31-08 places the burden of proof on the supplier. It is the professional who must prove that a contested clause is not abusive, rather than the consumer proving that it is.
*   **Consumer Associations:** Law 31-08 empowers consumer protection associations to represent the interests of the public and act on their behalf in legal proceedings.

## Conclusion: Key Takeaways

Understanding your rights is the first step toward a safe and fair consumer experience in Morocco. The legal system provides a safety net that professional suppliers cannot easily bypass. Key takeaways include:

*   Professional suppliers cannot use "no-warranty" clauses to escape liability for defective goods.
*   Abusive clauses that create an unfair imbalance in a contract are legally void.
*   Electronic and distance sellers must provide clear identification and reproducible contract terms.
*   The burden of proof regarding the fairness of a contract often rests with the professional supplier, not the consumer.

By remaining informed of these statutes, consumers can participate in the Moroccan economy with confidence, knowing that the law stands ready to protect their interests.
