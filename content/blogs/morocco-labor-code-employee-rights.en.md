# Morocco's Labor Code: Employee Rights and Employer Obligations

Understanding the legal framework governing the relationship between employers and employees is essential for maintaining a stable and productive professional environment. In Morocco, this relationship is primarily governed by Law No. 65.99, commonly known as the Labor Code (Code du Travail). 

Since its implementation in 2004, and through subsequent updates—including the significant amendments in 2021—the Labor Code has aimed to balance economic efficiency with the protection of worker rights. This article explores the fundamental aspects of Moroccan labor law, the nature of employment contracts, and the obligations both parties must uphold.

## The Foundation of the Employment Relationship

The Moroccan legal system distinguishes between different types of professional engagements. While the Dahir of Obligations and Contracts (DOC) historically governed "service hiring" (ijarat al-khidma), the modern Labor Code has largely superseded these provisions. Under Article 15 of the Labor Code, the term "employment contract" is the official designation for the bond between an employer and an employee.

A crucial principle established in Moroccan law is the prohibition of forced labor. Article 10 of the Labor Code strictly forbids the requisitioning of employees to perform work under duress or compulsion. Furthermore, the law sets a minimum age for employment to protect minors. According to Article 143, the legal age for admission to employment is generally 15 years, ensuring that young people are not exploited before they are physically and mentally prepared for the workforce.

For domestic workers, specific regulations apply under Law No. 19.12, which defines the unique conditions for employment and work within a household setting, ensuring that this category of workers also enjoys legal protection.

## Health, Safety, and the Role of the Occupational Physician

One of the most vital sections of the Moroccan Labor Code concerns the physical well-being of the employee. Employers are not merely responsible for paying wages; they must actively ensure a safe working environment.

Articles 315 and 316 of the Labor Code, supported by Decree No. 2.05.751, grant significant roles to the occupational physician (médecin du travail). The occupational physician acts as a consultant to the head of the enterprise and the social service department. Their responsibilities include:

*   Monitoring general hygiene conditions within the company.
*   Protecting employees from accidents and health hazards.
*   Assessing whether a specific job post is suitable for an employee’s physical health.
*   Improving working conditions, particularly regarding new equipment and the pace of work.

If an employee’s health or physical capacity changes due to age or illness, the employer is encouraged to consider measures such as transferring the employee to a different post or modifying their current duties to accommodate their physical endurance (Article 7).

## Collective Agreements and Dispute Resolution

While individual contracts define specific roles, Collective Labor Agreements (conventions collectives) play a major role in shaping industry standards. These agreements are negotiated between employers and trade unions to establish better working conditions than the minimums required by law.

When disputes arise, the Labor Code provides a structured path for resolution. Individual labor disputes—those concerning a single employee’s rights—are typically handled through the labor inspectorate or the court system. Article 128 empowers labor inspectors to monitor the application of collective agreements. Failure to respect these agreements can result in fines ranging from 300 to 20,000 Dirhams, depending on the number of employees affected.

In the public sector, specifically for institutions like the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco, separate statutes apply. For instance, Article 25 of the relevant statute grants female civil servants ten weeks of maternity leave, highlighting that while the Labor Code covers the private sector, specific administrative laws govern public officials.

## Termination of Employment and Statutes of Limitations

The dissolution of an employment relationship, whether through resignation or dismissal, is a highly regulated process. Employers must follow strict procedural fairness to avoid "abusive dismissal" claims. 

It is important for both parties to be aware of the "statute of limitations" (prescription) for legal claims. Under Article 395 of the Labor Code, any rights arising from individual employment contracts, vocational integration contracts, or apprenticeship contracts expire after two years. This two-year limit applies to all claims, whether they stem from the execution of the contract or its termination. 

This is a significant departure from the shorter limitation periods found in the older Dahir of Obligations and Contracts (Article 389), which often limited wage claims for certain workers to much shorter durations. Today, the two-year rule provides a clearer, unified window for employees to seek legal redress for unpaid wages, holiday pay, or compensation for dismissal.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Contractual Clarity:** The employment relationship is governed by the Labor Code (Law 65.99), which prioritizes the "employment contract" over older civil law concepts.
*   **Worker Protection:** Forced labor is strictly prohibited, and the minimum age for work is generally 15 years.
*   **Health is Paramount:** Employers must consult occupational physicians to ensure job posts are adapted to the physical health of the workers.
*   **Time Limits:** Employees have a two-year window to file legal claims regarding their employment rights or dismissal.
*   **Public vs. Private:** Private sector workers follow the Labor Code, while public sector employees are governed by specific administrative statutes regarding leave, retirement, and discipline.
