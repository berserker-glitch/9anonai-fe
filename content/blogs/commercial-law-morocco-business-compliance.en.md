# Moroccan Commercial Law: Business Compliance Guide for Companies

Navigating the legal landscape of North Africa requires a deep understanding of local regulations, especially for foreign investors and local entrepreneurs. Seeking professional **Moroccan commercial law advice** is the first step toward building a sustainable business. In Morocco, the legal framework is designed to promote investment while ensuring strict market discipline and fiscal responsibility.

Understanding **corporate legal compliance Morocco** involves mastering various facets of the law, from company formation and tax obligations to competition rules. This guide provides an educational overview of the essential legal requirements for companies operating within the Kingdom.

## Legal Personality and Company Formation in Morocco

Under **القانون التجاري المغربي** (Moroccan Commercial Law), the birth of a legal entity is tied to its registration. According to Law 17.95 (as amended), specifically Article 7, joint-stock companies (Sociétés Anonymes - SA) acquire a legal personality only upon their registration in the Commercial Register.

### Key Requirements for Joint-Stock Companies (SA)
For those seeking **droit commercial Maroc conseil**, it is vital to note the following structural requirements:
*   **Minimum Capital:** Article 6 stipulates that the share capital must not be less than 3 million MAD if the company publicly offers shares.
*   **Headquarters:** Article 5 states that companies with their registered office in Morocco are subject to Moroccan legislation. While a company may have a "real" headquarters elsewhere, third parties can rely on the statutory address registered with the authorities.
*   **Public Disclosure:** Every company must clearly state its name, followed by "Société Anonyme" or "S.A.," the amount of share capital, and its Commercial Register (Registre du Commerce) number on all documents and publications.

Until a company is officially registered, the relationships between shareholders are governed by the general principles of the Code of Obligations and Contracts (Dahir des Obligations et des Contrats).

## Corporate Tax Compliance and Fiscal Obligations

Achieving **conformité légale entreprise Maroc** requires strict adherence to the General Tax Code. Law 24.86, which governs corporate tax (IS - Impôt sur les Sociétés), applies to all profits and income derived from goods owned or activities carried out in Morocco, even if the company is based abroad.

### Foreign Companies and Branches
Foreign companies performing work or providing services in Morocco are subject to taxation on the gross amounts obtained. However, if these services are performed by a local branch or permanent establishment without the intervention of the foreign headquarters, the branch is taxed as if it were a Moroccan company.

### Mandatory Declarations
To ensure **الامتثال القانوني للشركات المغرب** (legal compliance for Moroccan companies), every new entity—except for "de facto" companies—must submit a declaration of establishment or settlement in Morocco within three months of starting operations. Failure to do so results in administrative fines.

### Depreciation and Assets
Moroccan tax law provides specific annual rates for the depreciation of fixed assets. For instance:
*   **Buildings:** Specific percentages apply (excluding land).
*   **Equipment and Furniture:** Subject to standard depreciation rates.
*   **Vehicles:** Often depreciated at a rate of 20% to 25% depending on the vehicle type and use.

## Competition Law and Market Freedom

One of the most critical aspects of **corporate legal compliance Morocco** is the Law on Freedom of Prices and Competition. This law applies to all natural and legal persons, regardless of whether they have a permanent headquarters in Morocco, as long as their operations impact the Moroccan market.

### Scope of Application
Article 1 of the Law on Freedom of Prices and Competition covers:
1.  All production, distribution, and service activities.
2.  Activities by public legal entities when acting as economic operators rather than exercising public authority.
3.  Export agreements if they affect the internal Moroccan market.

For businesses, this means that price-fixing, abuse of a dominant position, and anti-competitive mergers are strictly regulated to ensure a level playing field.

## Special Sectors and Development Zones

Morocco often creates specific legal frameworks for strategic sectors or geographic zones. For example, the **Tanger-Med Special Development Zone** operates under specific decrees that grant the managing company unique rights, such as the ability to acquire real estate through expropriation for public utility (Article 10) and the enjoyment of all rights and privileges granted to industrial and tourism developers (Article 11).

Similarly, the regulation of sensitive materials, such as explosives for civil use, is restricted to companies governed by Moroccan law that hold specific manufacturing or import licenses (Reference 3). This highlights the importance of industry-specific **SME legal services Morocco** to ensure that specialized permits are maintained.
