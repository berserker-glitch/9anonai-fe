# Income Improvement and Purchasing Power

Faced with inflation, attention turns to Labor Code reforms and finance laws to improve employees' income.

## SMIG Increase
The government is committed to continuing the progressive increase of the SMIG in industry and agriculture, aiming for their future unification to reduce disparities.

## Income Tax Revision
The real gain for employees in 2026 is the revision of Income Tax brackets.
- Raising the total exemption threshold.
- Lowering rates for the middle class.
This will result in a direct increase in the "net salary" at the end of the month.
