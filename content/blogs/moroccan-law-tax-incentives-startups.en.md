# Moroccan Law: Tax Incentives for Startups

Morocco has established itself as a premier destination for investment in North Africa, driven by a robust legal framework designed to encourage entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment. For startups and new enterprises, understanding the fiscal landscape is essential for long-term viability. The Moroccan legislature has enacted several key laws, most notably Law No. 24.86 regarding Corporate Tax and Framework Law No. 18.95 (the Investment Charter), to provide a competitive environment for business growth.

This article explores the fundamental tax structures, incentives, and legal protections available to startups and investment entities operating within the Kingdom.

## Corporate Tax Structure and Residency Rules

Under Moroccan law, the taxation of a business is primarily determined by its legal seat or "social seat" (siège social). According to **Article 5 of Law No. 17.95** relating to Joint Stock Companies (Sociétés Anonymes), any company with its social seat in Morocco is subject to Moroccan law.

From a fiscal perspective, **Law No. 24.86** establishes that companies, whether headquartered in Morocco or abroad, are liable for Corporate Tax (Impôt sur les Sociétés) on all profits related to goods they own, activities they perform, and profit-seeking operations they carry out in Morocco, even if such operations are occasional.

Key points regarding corporate tax include:
*   **Fiscal Residency:** Profits are generally taxed at the location of the company's head office or its principal establishment in Morocco.
*   **Foreign Entities:** Under **Article 12 of Law No. 24.86**, foreign companies (those without a head office in Morocco) are taxed on gross amounts received for works or services performed for Moroccan branches or independent persons residing in Morocco.
*   **Tax Rates:** While the standard corporate tax rate has historically been set at high benchmarks (such as 45% in specific older contexts of Article 14), modern reforms and specific sectors often benefit from reduced rates, sometimes as low as 10% for specific categories defined by the tax code.

## Investment Incentives and the Investment Charter

The Moroccan government provides significant support to startups and large-scale projects through **Framework Law No. 18.95**, which serves as an Investment Charter. This law is designed to alleviate the initial financial burdens on new businesses.

### State Support for Infrastructure and Training
Under **Article 17** of the Investment Charter, enterprises that undertake investment programmes of "major importance"—defined by the amount of investment, job creation, or technology transfer—can enter into specific contracts with the State. These contracts may grant the following benefits:
1.  Partial exemption from the costs of acquiring land necessary for the investment.
2.  Assistance with external infrastructure expenses.
3.  Support for vocational training costs.

### The Investment Promotion Fund
**Article 18** establishes the "Investment Promotion Fund" (Fonds de Promotion des Investissements). This fund is specifically allocated to manage the costs of benefits granted to investors under the aforementioned state contracts, ensuring that the government’s commitments to support private enterprise are financially backed.

## Protections for Foreign Investors and Startups

Morocco offers a highly attractive environment for international founders and venture capitalists through a guaranteed "Convertibility System." This is vital for startups that rely on foreign capital.

As per the Investment Charter, investors who fund their projects in foreign currency benefit from:
*   **Profit Repatriation:** The right to transfer net-of-tax profits abroad without limits on amount or duration.
*   **Liquidation Rights:** The freedom to transfer the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of the investment, including any capital gains.

Furthermore, to ensure a secure legal environment, **Article 17** allows for international arbitration clauses in contracts between the Moroccan State and foreign investors, providing a mechanism for dispute resolution in accordance with international conventions.

## Sector-Specific Opportunities: Sustainable Energy and Innovation

The Moroccan legal framework also creates specialized vehicles for strategic sectors. For example, **Law No. 57.09** created the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN). This entity, structured as a Joint Stock Company (Société Anonyme) under **Law No. 17.95**, demonstrates how the state uses private-law corporate structures to achieve national industrial goals.

Startups operating in green technology, industry, and new technologies are often the primary beneficiaries of the **Moroccan Investment Development Agency (AMDIE)**. Established under **Law No. 41.08**, this agency is responsible for proposing legislative measures to support investment and simplifying procedures for potential investors in modern technological sectors.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Navigating Moroccan business law requires a clear understanding of the interplay between corporate obligations and investment incentives. For a startup, the key takeaways are:

*   **Legal Form Matters:** Choosing between a Joint Stock Company (SA) or other forms affects your minimum capital requirements (e.g., 3 million MAD for SAs inviting public subscription under **Article 6 of Law No. 17.95**).
*   **Leverage the Charter:** Explore the possibility of an investment contract with the State if your startup involves significant job creation or technology transfer.
*   **Fiscal Responsibility:** Be aware that all activities performed on Moroccan soil, even by foreign entities, trigger tax obligations unless specific exemptions (like those for non-profit associations under **Article 4 of Law No. 24.86**) apply.

By aligning business strategies with these legal provisions, entrepreneurs can significantly reduce their tax burden and secure their investments in the Moroccan market.
