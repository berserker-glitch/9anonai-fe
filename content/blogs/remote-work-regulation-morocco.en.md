# Institutionalizing Remote Work

The pandemic imposed a new reality: remote work. Today, the Moroccan legislator seeks to regulate this work mode to protect everyone's rights.

## Flexible Contracts
The Labor Code will integrate provisions on:
- Working hours and "Right to disconnect" outside work hours.
- Employer coverage of equipment and Internet costs.
- Recognition of accidents occurring at home during work hours as "work accidents".

This regulation will encourage hiring talent regardless of geography and offer more flexibility.
