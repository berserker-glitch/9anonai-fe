# Moroccan Law on Whistleblowing: Legal Framework and Protections

In the modern corporate and administrative world, the act of reporting misconduct—commonly known as whistleblowing—serves as a vital mechanism for maintaining ethics and transparency. In Morocco, the legal landscape surrounding whistleblowing has evolved significantly, shifting from a culture of silence toward one of accountability, particularly in matters of corruption, financial crimes, and public safety.

For employees and citizens, understanding the legal protections and procedures available is essential. This article explores the Moroccan legal framework governing whistleblowing, the protections afforded to those who report violations, and the specific sectors where reporting is not just encouraged, but legally structured.

## The Legal Foundation of Reporting in Morocco

Whistleblowing in Morocco is primarily governed by a combination of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Penal Code, and specific sector-related laws. Unlike some jurisdictions that have a single "Whistleblower Act," Morocco integrates these protections across various legal texts to ensure that those who report crimes are shielded from retaliation.

Under **Article 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Reference 2)**, the Moroccan judicial system asserts its jurisdiction over crimes that affect the interests of the Kingdom, even when committed abroad. This demonstrates the state's commitment to pursuing justice. More importantly, the law recognizes the principle of *non bis in idem* (not being tried twice for the same crime), which ensures legal certainty for individuals involved in cross-border legal matters.

In the context of reporting, Moroccan law encourages individuals to come forward with information regarding:
*   Acts of corruption and bribery.
*   Terrorist threats and financing.
*   Financial irregularities in banking and credit institutions.
*   Violations of public health and safety regulations.

## Sector-Specific Whistleblowing: Finance and Industry

Morocco has implemented rigorous oversight in the financial and industrial sectors, where whistleblowing is critical for economic stability.

### The Banking and Credit Sector
Under the **Law relating to Credit Information Bureaus (Reference 5)**, Bank Al-Maghrib (the Central Bank) holds significant power to penalize institutions that violate transparency and reporting standards. **Article 44** of this law stipulates heavy fines—ranging from 250,000 to 1,000,000 Dirhams—for those who fail to comply with management and reporting requirements. 

For employees in this sector, reporting internal mismanagement or the provision of false information to the Central Bank is protected under the broader framework of professional ethics. **Article 45** further penalizes managers who obstruct investigations or hide information from regulators, reinforcing the duty of transparency.

### Telecommunications and Infrastructure
In specialized sectors like telecommunications, the law ensures that operators follow strict "Books of Specifications" (Cahier des Charges). For instance, **Reference 3** regarding Itissalat Al-Maghrib details the regulatory oversight by the National Agency for Telecommunications Regulation (ANRT). Employees who observe deviations from these legal obligations or the misuse of public resources (like radio frequencies) have a legal basis to report these discrepancies to the regulatory body.

## Protection of Informants and Criminal Procedure

One of the primary concerns for any whistleblower is the fear of professional or physical retaliation. Moroccan law has addressed this through specific provisions in the **Code of Criminal Procedure**.

### Anonymity and Safety
The Moroccan legislator has introduced measures to protect witnesses, experts, and whistleblowers (denouncers). These include:
1.  **Identity Protection:** In certain sensitive cases, the identity of the person reporting the crime can be kept confidential in official records to prevent retaliation.
2.  **Protection Against Retaliation:** Employees are protected under the Labour Code and general principles of law against "abusive dismissal" if the reason for their termination was a good-faith report of illegal activity within the company.

### Reporting Procedures
When a violation is detected—for example, a breach of health emergency laws as seen in **Reference 1**—the process involves a formal "Observation Minute" (Procès-verbal de constatation). This document serves as legal proof of the violation. A whistleblower's role is often to initiate the investigation that leads to the drafting of such official reports by the Judicial Police or authorized administrative agents.

## Whistleblowing in High-Stakes Areas: Nuclear and Terrorism

Moroccan law is particularly stringent regarding whistleblowing in areas of national security and public safety. 

**Law No. 142.12 (Reference 6)**, which concerns nuclear and radiological safety, emphasizes the importance of reporting incidents involving hazardous materials. Given the technical nature of these risks, the law prioritizes the regulations of the Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNuR). Employees in this sector have a legal duty to report any non-compliance with safety protocols to prevent catastrophic environmental or health consequences.

Similarly, in the fight against terrorism, the **Law on Combating Terrorism (Reference 7)** provides a framework where reporting suspected activities is a civic and legal duty. The law ensures that even if an act is committed outside the Kingdom, Moroccan courts have the jurisdiction to intervene, provided the suspect is on national territory.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Whistleblowing in Morocco is a cornerstone of the country's efforts to promote integrity and the rule of law. While the legal system provides various protections, whistleblowers must ensure they act in "good faith" and follow the prescribed legal channels to remain protected.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Legal Basis:** Protections are found in the Code of Criminal Procedure and specific laws governing finance, safety, and ethics.
*   **Professional Duty:** In sectors like banking and nuclear safety, reporting violations is often a legal requirement for managers and employees.
*   **Institutional Support:** Bodies like Bank Al-Maghrib, ANRT, and AMSSNuR serve as the primary recipients of specialized reports.
*   **Consequences of Obstruction:** Moroccan law imposes heavy fines and even imprisonment for those who attempt to hide information or obstruct official investigations.

By understanding these laws, employees and citizens can contribute to a more ethical and transparent society while remaining within the bounds of legal protection.
