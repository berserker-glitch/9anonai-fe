# Law on Data Governance

The digital transformation of the Moroccan economy has necessitated a robust legal framework to manage, protect, and leverage information. Data governance in Morocco is not governed by a single, isolated code but rather by a sophisticated network of laws, decrees, and institutional mandates. These regulations ensure that data—ranging from commercial records to credit histories—is handled with integrity, security, and transparency.

Effective data governance is essential for fostering an environment of trust for both domestic and foreign investors. By establishing clear rules on how information is collected, stored, and shared, the Moroccan legal system ensures high standards of data quality and security, which are the pillars of a modern digital economy.

## The Institutional Framework for Investment and Economic Data

Data governance begins with the systematic collection and dissemination of economic information. Under the Decree concerning the competencies and organisation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment, the government is mandated to provide comprehensive data to investors.

According to Article 10 of this Decree, the Directorate of Foreign Investments is structured to include a Department of Informatics and Investor Guidance. This department is responsible for:
*   Providing foreign investors with all necessary information regarding economic, financial, and tax legislation.
*   Managing the "Reception and Assistance Service" to guide investors through the regulatory landscape.
*   Ensuring that economic data is accessible through brochures, digital platforms, and technical documents.

Furthermore, the creation of the National Documentation Centre (Centre National de Documentation) under the government authority in charge of planning plays a pivotal role in data management. As per Article 1 of its founding Decree, the Centre is tasked with collecting and classifying all documents related to the economic and social development of the Kingdom. This includes indexing international studies and representing Morocco in global documentation conferences, ensuring that the nation's data practices align with international standards.

## Credit Information Bureaus and Financial Data Quality

In the financial sector, data governance is strictly regulated to maintain the stability of the banking system. Law No. 43.12 (The Law relating to Credit Information Bureaus) establishes a rigorous oversight mechanism managed by Bank Al-Maghrib (the Central Bank of Morocco).

Data quality and integrity are paramount here. Article 10 of this law stipulates that Bank Al-Maghrib must prepare and regularly update a list of authorized Credit Information Bureaus. This list is published on the Central Bank’s website to ensure transparency.

To ensure high-level data security and institutional stability, Article 11 requires prior authorization from the Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib for several critical operations, including:
*   Any change in the company name or statutes.
*   Any transfer of the registered office within Morocco.
*   Any operation affecting the shareholder structure or the governance of the bureau.

This level of oversight prevents unauthorized changes that could compromise the sensitivity and accuracy of financial data.

## Digital Commercial Registration and Corporate Transparency

Morocco has made significant strides in digital data management through the modernisation of the Commercial Register. Recent decrees concerning the electronic Commercial Register (Registre du Commerce Électronique) have revolutionised how corporate data is filed and accessed.

Under Article 40 and Article 50 of the Commercial Code, companies and individual traders are required to submit digital declarations for registration and amendments. This system ensures:
*   **Data Accuracy:** For foreigners residing in Morocco, registration requires specific identification such as the registration card number or passport details (Reference 4).
*   **Traceability:** Legal entities must provide detailed information about parent companies, including their legal form and registered office, whether in Morocco or abroad (Reference 5).
*   **Efficiency:** The transition to electronic filing of summary statements (Etats de Synthèse) allows for real-time updates to the corporate database, enhancing the overall quality of public commercial data.

## Data Security and Archiving Standards

Data governance is incomplete without robust archiving and security protocols. The Law relating to Archives (Reference 3) establishes "Archives du Maroc" as the central institution responsible for the preservation of the nation’s data assets. This ensures that information is not only managed during its active lifecycle but also preserved securely for legal and historical purposes.

Additionally, the transformation of entities like Barid Al-Maghrib into joint-stock companies (Sociétés Anonymes) under Law No. 07.08 demonstrates the shift toward corporate governance models in data-heavy sectors like postal and financial services. By adopting the governance structures of joint-stock companies, these entities implement professional management standards that naturally encompass data security and risk management.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Data governance in Morocco is a multi-layered discipline that bridges the gap between administrative transparency and financial security. From the Ministry of Foreign Trade’s duty to inform investors to the Central Bank’s strict oversight of credit data, the law ensures that information is treated as a strategic asset.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Transparency:** Government institutions are legally bound to provide investors with updated legislative and economic data.
*   **Strict Oversight:** Financial data bureaus operate under the direct supervision of Bank Al-Maghrib to ensure data security and governance stability.
*   **Digital Integration:** The shift to the Electronic Commercial Register has improved data quality and simplified the process for both local and foreign businesses.
*   **Centralisation:** The National Documentation Centre and Archives du Maroc serve as the backbones for systematic data classification and long-term storage.
