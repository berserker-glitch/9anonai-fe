# Electronic Monitoring: Prisons Without Bars

The adoption of "electronic monitoring" (electronic bracelet) marks a turning point in the Moroccan penal system. This mechanism allows the convict to serve their sentence outside prison walls, while restricting their movements.

## How Does it Work?
The convict wears a bracelet connected via GPS, allowing authorities to track their location in real-time.
- A geographical zone (home, workplace) is defined where the convict is allowed to be.
- Any exit from this zone triggers an immediate alert for the police.

## Who Benefits?
This sentence is generally granted to people convicted of short sentences, who have a fixed abode and do not pose a direct danger to society. It allows them to keep their jobs and family ties, facilitating their reintegration.
