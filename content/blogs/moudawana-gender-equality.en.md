# Guardianship and Shared Responsibility

The expected reform of the Family Code is based on a constitutional principle: gender equality. It aims to eliminate obsolete discriminations that hinder women's role.

## Legal Guardianship
One of the major points is granting the mother "legal guardianship" over her children, just like the father. Currently, divorcees and widows face major administrative obstacles (travel, school, surgery) due to lack of guardianship.

## Asset Sharing
The law also tends towards institutionalizing the "sharing of acquired assets" during marriage, to protect the party (often the wife) who contributed to family wealth without documented income.
