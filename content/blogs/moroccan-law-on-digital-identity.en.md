# Moroccan Law on Digital Identity

The digitalization of the Moroccan economy and administration has necessitated a robust legal framework to govern identity, commercial transactions, and institutional oversight. As the Kingdom moves toward an integrated e-government model, several laws have been enacted to ensure that digital identities—whether for individuals, corporations, or financial institutions—are secure, verifiable, and legally binding.

Understanding the legal landscape of digital identity in Morocco requires looking at a cross-section of financial regulations, commercial codes, and administrative reforms. These laws collectively provide the infrastructure for a modern, digital-first society.

## The Digitalization of Commercial Identity and the Trade Register

One of the most significant advancements in Moroccan digital law is the transition of the Trade Register (Registre du Commerce) into a digital format. Under the Decree implementing provisions related to publication in the Electronic Commercial Register, Morocco has streamlined how legal entities establish their identity.

According to the Commercial Code, specifically Article 50 regarding declarations of amendment, companies must maintain accurate digital records. The legal framework now allows for:

*   **Electronic Filing:** The electronic filing of summary statements and corporate documents.
*   **Identity Verification for Foreigners:** For foreign residents in Morocco, the registration card number (carte de séjour) serves as the primary identifier. For non-residents, the passport number or an equivalent document is required to prove identity during commercial registration.
*   **Transparency:** Every legal entity is assigned a specific registration number in the Commercial Register, which acts as its unique digital fingerprint in the Moroccan marketplace.

This system ensures that the "identity" of a company is not just a paper trail but a verifiable digital data point accessible to authorities and partners.

## Financial Identity and Statistical Declarations

Digital identity extends beyond simple identification; it encompasses the digital footprint of financial transactions. Law No. 19.06 establishes the framework for statistical declarations regarding foreign exchanges and the international investment position of Morocco.

Under Article 1 of Law 19.06, all commercial and financial operations between residents and non-residents must be declared. This law is pivotal for e-government and financial transparency because it:

1.  Mandates the digital reporting of capital movements between Morocco and abroad.
2.  Requires statistical declarations for all operations involving the balance of payments.
3.  Integrates these declarations into the national financial database, ensuring that the "financial identity" of the country's economic actors is monitored for stability and compliance.

## Institutional Oversight: Bank Al-Maghrib and the People’s Credit

The security of digital identity in the financial sector is overseen by powerful national institutions. The Basic Statute of Bank Al-Maghrib (the Central Bank of Morocco), governed by Law No. 40.17 and implemented by Dahir No. 1.19.82, grants the bank the authority to oversee the payment systems and the security of financial exchanges.

Similarly, Law No. 12.96, which reformed the People's Credit of Morocco (Crédit Populaire du Maroc), emphasizes the collective representation of credit institutions to protect their "common rights and interests." These institutions are responsible for:

*   Determining and monitoring common management rules.
*   Ensuring that digital identities used in banking transactions are subject to rigorous oversight and audit.

By regulating how banks identify their clients and report their data, Moroccan law creates a trusted environment for digital banking and e-commerce.

## Future Horizons: The 2030 Vision and Maritime Identity

Morocco’s commitment to a digital and modernized future is further evidenced by Law No. 35.25, which created the "Morocco 2030 Foundation" (moussat al-Maghrib 2030). This institution is tasked with overseeing strategic developments that will likely include the further integration of digital identity into public services.

Furthermore, digital identity and sovereignty extend to the maritime domain. Law No. 1.81 establishes an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles off the Moroccan coast. In a modern context, monitoring this zone relies heavily on digital identification systems for vessels and maritime resources, proving that legal identity is essential for both national security and economic sovereignty.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

The legal framework for digital identity in Morocco is a multifaceted system designed to support a secure e-government ecosystem. By integrating commercial, financial, and institutional regulations, the Kingdom ensures that digital interactions are as legally valid as physical ones.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Corporate Identity:** Companies must use the Electronic Commercial Register for all filings and amendments under Article 50 of the Commercial Code.
*   **Individual Identification:** Foreigners must provide specific identification (registration cards or passports) to participate in the digital commercial registry.
*   **Financial Compliance:** Law 19.06 requires mandatory digital declarations for international financial movements to maintain the integrity of the national balance of payments.
*   **Regulatory Authority:** Bank Al-Maghrib and the Morocco 2030 Foundation serve as the institutional pillars for a secure and modernized digital future.
