# Quality School for All

Education reform is shifting into high gear with the implementation of Law 59.21. The goal is to break with traditional rote learning methods and focus on acquiring fundamental skills.

## Pioneer Schools
This is the flagship initiative of this reform. Model schools are equipped with modern means, specific training for teachers, and new pedagogical methods (TaRL). Preliminary results show a marked improvement in reading and mathematics.

## Fighting School Dropout
The new law criminalizes school dropout and makes education mandatory until age 16, holding the State and parents responsible for schooling, especially in rural areas.
