# Real Estate Sale: Simplified Procedures

The 2026 Finance Law brings good news for foreigners and MREs owning property in Morocco. The "Tax Clearance" (Quitus Fiscal) necessary to sell and repatriate funds is simplified.

## Key Changes
- **Digitalization**: Obtaining certificates remotely.
- **Calculation Clarity**: Precise criteria for TPI (Real Estate Profit Tax), reducing the administration's discretionary power.

These measures aim to boost the market and reassure investors about the ease of "exit strategy".
