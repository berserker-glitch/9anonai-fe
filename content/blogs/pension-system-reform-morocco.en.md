# The Future of Pensions in Morocco

Pension reform is a "ticking time bomb". Actuarial studies show a chronic structural deficit if nothing is done.

## Scenarios on the Table
The government is discussing several options with unions:
1. **Retirement Age**: Progressive increase towards 65.
2. **Contributions**: Increasing rates for employees and employers.
3. **Calculation**: Basing pension on career average rather than just the last few years.

The challenge is ensuring system sustainability while preserving retirees' purchasing power.
