# Reform of the Code of Obligations and Contracts

The Moroccan legal landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years, particularly regarding the foundational pillars of civil and commercial life. At the heart of this evolution is the **Dahir of 9 Ramadan 1331 (August 12, 1913)**, which constitutes the Code of Obligations and Contracts (Dahir formant Code des Obligations et des Contrats - DOC). As Morocco continues to modernise its economy and strengthen its position in international trade, the legislature has introduced several reforms to this century-old code to align it with contemporary digital and financial realities.

Understanding these reforms is essential for business owners, legal practitioners, and citizens alike, as the Code of Obligations and Contracts governs everything from basic sales agreements to complex security interests and digital transactions.

## Digital Transformation and Trust Services

One of the most pivotal shifts in Moroccan civil law involves the transition from physical to digital documentation. Under the reforms introduced by laws relating to trust services for electronic transactions, the Code of Obligations and Contracts has been adapted to grant legal functional equivalence to electronic data.

Specifically, amendments to **Article 2.1** and **Article 3** of the DOC (as modified by subsequent legislation) have redefined the requirements for written proof. Traditionally, "writing" was synonymous with paper and ink. Today, Moroccan law recognises electronic signatures and digital documents as having the same evidentiary value as their paper counterparts, provided the methods used to create them offer sufficient guarantees of integrity and attribution.

This reform is not merely technical; it is a fundamental shift in the theory of obligations. It allows businesses to conclude contracts remotely with legal certainty, reducing transaction costs and modernising the judicial process when disputes arise over the validity of a digital agreement.

## Modernising Movable Securities and Collateral

A major thrust of recent legislative activity has been the reform of **Movable Securities (Sûretés Mobilières)**. Law No. 21.18 has significantly overhauled the DOC to facilitate access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Key changes include:
*   **Repeal and Replacement of Articles:** Law 21.18 repealed certain traditional provisions, such as the indemnity under **Article 1249**, and introduced a more flexible framework for securing debts.
*   **The National Electronic Register:** One of the most significant practical applications is the creation of a National Electronic Register of Movable Securities. Under the reformed **Article 3 of the Commercial Code** (related to debt pledges), a pledge over a debt becomes enforceable against third parties through registration in this electronic registry.
*   **Pledging Debts:** Modern business law now allows for the pledging of partial debts and future receivables. According to the updated framework, the pledge extends to the accessories of the debt unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

These reforms are designed to allow businesses to use their intangible assets—such as accounts receivable, intellectual property, or equipment—as collateral for financing, moving away from the heavy reliance on real estate mortgages.

## Commercial Obligations and International Standards

The reform of the Code of Obligations and Contracts does not exist in a vacuum; it is closely linked to the **Commercial Code** and international financial regulations. For instance, **Law No. 19.06** establishes strict requirements for statistical declarations regarding foreign exchanges and the balance of payments.

Under **Article 1 of Law 19.06**, these provisions apply to commercial and financial operations between residents and non-residents. This intersects with the DOC when determining the validity of cross-border obligations and the movement of funds. 

Furthermore, when a debt pledge is governed by a foreign law but involves a debtor habitually resident in Morocco, **Article 4 of the Commercial Code** stipulates that the pledge is enforceable in Morocco subject to the conditions of the law governing the pledged debt, while respecting Moroccan public policy (ordre public) and international conventions ratified by the Kingdom.

## Protection of Rights in Administrative and Civil Contexts

The Moroccan legal system also maintains specific protections regarding the termination of professional relationships and the recovery of debts. For example, the **Royal Decree (Decret Royal) No. 316.66** provides for compensation upon the dismissal of certain categories of employees, referencing **Article 754 of the DOC**. This demonstrates how the general principles of the Code of Obligations and Contracts serve as a safety net for more specific statutes in administrative and labour law.

In the realm of agricultural and civil leases, the DOC continues to provide robust protections for creditors. **Section II of the DOC** outlines "privileges" or priority rights for landlords, granting them a lien over the crops of the year or the equipment used on the leased land to ensure the payment of rent.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

The ongoing reform of the Moroccan Code of Obligations and Contracts reflects a nation in transition. By integrating digital signatures, modernising security interests, and aligning with international commercial standards, Morocco is creating a more predictable and efficient legal environment for business.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Digital Validity:** Electronic documents and signatures now carry the same legal weight as physical ones under amended DOC provisions.
*   **Access to Credit:** The new system for movable securities and the National Electronic Register makes it easier for businesses to leverage assets for loans.
*   **Legal Integration:** Civil law (DOC) and Commercial law are increasingly integrated, especially regarding international transactions and debt enforcement.
*   **Protection of Priority:** The law maintains specific "privileges" for certain creditors, such as landlords, to ensure financial stability in the real estate and agricultural sectors.
