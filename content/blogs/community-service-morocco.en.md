# TIG: Serving Society Instead of Prison

Community Service (TIG) is the flagship measure of the new law on alternative sentencing. It is based on a philosophy of "reparation" towards society rather than pure "punishment".

## Procedure
1. The judge proposes TIG to the convict (for minor offenses).
2. The convict **must accept** expressly. Forced labor being forbidden by the constitution.
3. The work is performed in public institutions, local authorities, or public utility associations.

## Duration and Nature
- The duration varies between 40 and 3600 hours.
- The work must be done during the convict's free time so as not to hinder their professional activity or studies.

This is an opportunity, especially for young first-time offenders, to avoid "the school of crime" that prison can be.
