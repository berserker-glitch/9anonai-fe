# End of Prison for Petty Crimes?

Morocco begins a new era in its penal policy with the entry into force of the law on alternative sentencing. This long-awaited legislation aims to humanize punishment and solve the prison overcrowding crisis (over 100,000 inmates).

## What are the Alternatives?
The judge can now pronounce, instead of prison time:
1. **Community Service (TIG)**: Working for free for an administration or association (40 to 3600 hours).
2. **Electronic Monitoring**: Wearing an electronic bracelet.
3. **Daily Fine**: Paying a sum of money for each avoided day of prison.

## Eligibility Conditions
- The pronounced sentence must be less than 5 years.
- The convict must not be a repeat offender.
- Consent of the convict (except for the fine).

This is a major step forward for human rights in Morocco, aligning the country with international standards.
