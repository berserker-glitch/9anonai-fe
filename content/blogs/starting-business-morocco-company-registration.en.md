# Starting a Business in Morocco: Legal Guide to Company Registration

The Moroccan economy has become a hub for entrepreneurship in North Africa, offering a strategic gateway between Europe and the rest of the continent. However, navigating the bureaucratic landscape requires a firm understanding of the local regulatory framework. Whether you are a local entrepreneur or an international investor, securing **company registration legal help Morocco** is often the first step toward a successful venture.

This guide explores the essential legal pathways for establishing a business, from the simplified Auto-Entrepreneur status to the registration of complex corporate entities.

## 1. Choosing the Right Legal Structure: From Auto-Entrepreneur to SARL

The first step in any business journey is selecting a legal form that suits your turnover expectations and liability preferences. Moroccan law provides several options, each governed by specific statutes.

### The Auto-Entrepreneur Scheme
For solo consultants and small service providers, the **Auto-Entrepreneur** status (Mokawel Dati) is often the most efficient route. Governed by **Law No. 114.13**, this system offers simplified tax and social security benefits. 
*   **Registration Process:** According to Decree applying Articles 5, 6, and 8 of Law 114.13, registration is initiated electronically via the National Register of Auto-Entrepreneurs. 
*   **Physical Filing:** After the online application, the entrepreneur must personally deposit the signed file at a designated "Barid Al-Maghrib" (Post Office) window within 30 days.
*   **Loss of Status:** It is important to note that under **Article 8 of Law 114.13**, an individual loses this status if their turnover exceeds the legal threshold for two consecutive years or if they decide to transition into a formal company structure.

For those seeking **startup legal advice Morocco**, the *Société à Responsabilité Limitée* (SARL) remains the most popular choice. It protects personal assets and allows for multiple shareholders. If you are looking for **création société Maroc assistance juridique**, understanding the transition from a simple idea to a registered legal person is vital.

## 2. Navigating the Electronic Commercial Register (Registre du Commerce)

Morocco has significantly modernized its administrative procedures through digitalization. The **Electronic Commercial Register** is now the central pillar for business transparency and legal existence.

Under the Decree regarding the electronic commercial register and the filing of summary statements, companies are required to provide detailed information including:
*   The legal form and company name.
*   The registered office address (Siège Social).
*   Details regarding the legal representative or manager.

**Article 40 of the Commercial Code** specifies that when registering branches or agencies of a legal entity, specific declarations must be filed. This is particularly relevant for foreign companies looking for **legal support for startups Morocco** to establish a local presence. The declaration must include the parent company’s registration number and the court of jurisdiction.

Protecting your brand is as important as the registration itself. The **Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC)**, established by **Law No. 13.99**, manages the protection of trademarks, patents, and trade names.

Before finalizing your "création société Maroc," you must obtain a **Certificat Négatif**. This document proves that your chosen company name is unique and not already in use by another entity. **Decree No. 2.99.71** outlines the operational procedures for OMPIC, ensuring that industrial property is protected under the provisions of **Law No. 17.97**.

## 4. Digital Transformation in Company Creation

The Moroccan government has introduced measures to facilitate the electronic creation of businesses. **Decree No. 2.22.92** (related to Law 13.99) focuses on the procedures for creating companies via an integrated electronic platform.

This platform allows various administrations to access a secure account to process applications and verify documents directly. For entrepreneurs, this means:
*   Reduced physical paperwork.
*   Faster processing times for the "registre de commerce."
*   Integrated coordination between the Tax Authority, the Commercial Court, and Social Security (CNSS).

*   The name of the domiciliary (the provider).
*   The provider's commercial register number.
*   The start and end dates of the domiciliation contract.

This is a practical solution for startups in their early stages, but it requires a formal written agreement to be accepted by the tax authorities and the commercial court.
