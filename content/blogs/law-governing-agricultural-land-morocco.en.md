# Law Governing Agricultural Land in Morocco

Morocco’s legal framework regarding agricultural land is a sophisticated blend of historical tradition, sovereign decrees, and modern administrative reforms. As the nation moves toward the ambitious goals of the "Morocco 2030" vision, understanding the legalities of land ownership, production standards, and institutional oversight is essential for investors, farmers, and legal practitioners alike.

The Moroccan legislator has consistently sought to balance the protection of national food security with the need for economic modernization. This article explores the primary legal pillars governing agricultural land, from the recovery of colonial-era assets to the modern technical standards for crop production.

## The Historical Context: Recovery of Agricultural Lands

A foundational aspect of Moroccan agricultural law involves the transition of land from colonial administration to national sovereignty. This is largely governed by specific Royal Decrees (*Dahirs*) that addressed the status of lands previously held by foreign settlers.

Under **Royal Decree (Law) No. 1.67.718**, issued on 1 March 1968, the state established clear protocols for managing "colonial lands" that belonged to Moroccans. This law was built upon the framework of **Decree No. 1.63.289** (September 1963), which defined the conditions under which the state could recover agricultural land.

These legal instruments ensured that agricultural assets were reintegrated into the national economy, providing a structured approach to property rights during a critical period of state-building. Today, these laws remind us that land ownership in Morocco is deeply tied to the nation's sovereign history and the equitable distribution of rural resources.

## Technical Standards: Seed Production and Marketing

Modern agricultural land management is not merely about who owns the soil, but also about what is permitted to grow upon it. The Moroccan government maintains strict oversight over the quality of agricultural inputs to ensure sustainable development and high-yield production.

According to the **Dahir relating to the organization of production and marketing of seeds and plants**, specific regulations govern the agricultural cycle:

1.  **The Official Index:** Under **Article 4**, the Ministry of Agriculture maintains an official index of plant species and varieties authorized for cultivation in Morocco. Registration in this index is mandatory and requires a proposal from the "National Committee for Seed and Plant Acquisition."
2.  **Quality Control:** Monitoring of cultivation for seed production is subject to fees and administrative oversight. This ensures that the seeds used on Moroccan agricultural land meet biological and environmental standards.
3.  **Ministerial Oversight:** The Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Finance jointly determine the fees and procedures for these technical assessments, ensuring that the agricultural sector remains both regulated and economically viable.

## Institutional Support and the "Morocco 2030" Vision

The legal landscape is currently evolving to meet future challenges through the creation of specialized institutions. A significant recent development is **Law No. 35.25**, implemented by **Dahir No. 1.25.54** (August 2025), which established the **"Morocco 2030 Foundation."**

This institution is designed to oversee strategic projects that align with the Kingdom’s long-term development goals. In the context of agricultural land, such institutions play a role in:

*   Promoting sustainable development practices to combat climate change and water scarcity.
*   Integrating modern irrigation technologies into traditional farming landscapes.
*   Ensuring that land use aligns with the national economic strategy for the next decade.

Furthermore, agricultural projects often require significant capital. While **Law No. 50.21** governs credit institutions, it is important to note that certain entities, such as the **Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development** (governed by Law No. 36.01), are exempted from standard banking regulations to more flexibly support large-scale agricultural and social infrastructure projects (as per **Article 23** of the Banking Law).

## Maritime and Environmental Considerations

Agricultural land law in Morocco does not stop at the shoreline. The Kingdom’s sovereignty over its resources extends to the **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)** and the Continental Shelf, governed by **Law No. 1.81**.

Under **Article 1** of this law, Morocco maintains an EEZ extending 200 nautical miles from its coast. This legal status is relevant for coastal agricultural projects and the management of marine resources that interact with land-based ecosystems. Protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources—whether on land or at sea—is a constitutional priority under **Articles 42 and 50** of the Moroccan Constitution.

## Key Takeaways for Stakeholders

Understanding the legalities of agricultural land in Morocco requires a multi-faceted approach:

*   **Property Rights:** Historical decrees still influence the status of certain rural land parcels, particularly those categorized under state-recovered colonial lands.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Farmers must adhere to the "Official Index" for seeds and plants to ensure their production is legally recognized and marketable.
*   **Institutional Framework:** New entities like the "Morocco 2030 Foundation" will increasingly dictate the strategic direction of land use and sustainable development.
*   **Financial Resources:** Specialized funds often provide the necessary capital for agricultural expansion, operating under specific legal frameworks outside of standard commercial banking.

Morocco’s commitment to legal clarity in the agricultural sector provides a stable environment for growth, ensuring that the "green" future of the Kingdom is built on a solid legislative foundation.
