# "Lawyering is Not a Trade"

Moroccan courts experienced near-paralysis due to lawyer strikes rejecting the draft law regulating their profession. They believe the text infringes on the independence of the defense.

## Points of Divergence
1. **Access**: New exam conditions and training in a dedicated institute, seen as a barrier.
2. **Taxation**: Imposition of withholding tax, deemed unfair especially for young lawyers.
3. **Discipline**: Increasing prosecutor powers in disciplinary proceedings against lawyers, seen as interference.

Lawyers demand a text that immunizes the defense, not one that places it under guardianship.
