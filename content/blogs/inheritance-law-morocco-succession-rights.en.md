# Inheritance Law in Morocco: Your Rights to Succession and Estate

Navigating the complexities of estate planning and distribution can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with a legal system rooted in both civil codes and religious principles. Understanding **inheritance law Morocco help** is essential for both Moroccan citizens and foreign residents who own assets within the Kingdom. Whether you are dealing with the loss of a loved one or planning for the future, knowing how your estate will be handled ensures that your heirs are protected and your legacy is preserved according to the law.

In Morocco, the legal framework governing succession is primarily found in the Family Code, known as the **Moudawana** (Law No. 70.03). This code integrates traditional Islamic jurisprudence with modern administrative requirements to create a comprehensive system for **الإرث في القانون المغربي** (inheritance in Moroccan law).

## The Legal Foundation of Droit Successoral Maroc

The primary source for all matters related to the family, including marriage, divorce, and succession, is the Moroccan Family Code. According to **Article 2 of Law 70.03**, the provisions of this code apply to all Moroccans, including those holding dual nationality, as well as refugees and stateless persons.

For those seeking to understand **droit successoral Maroc**, it is important to note that the law differentiates based on religious affiliation. While the Moudawana applies to Muslims, Moroccan Jews are governed by the Hebraic Moroccan personal status rules. This distinction ensures that the religious and cultural identities of Morocco’s diverse population are respected in matters of domestic and estate law.

### Who is Eligible to Inherit?
Inheritance is triggered by the death of the "de cujus" (the deceased). Under **الإرث في القانون المغربي**, there are three main reasons for inheritance:
1.  **Kinship (Lineage):** This includes children, parents, and siblings.
2.  **Marriage:** The surviving spouse is a legal heir.
3.  **Wills (Wasiya):** A person can bequeath up to one-third of their estate to a non-heir, provided it does not infringe upon the mandatory shares of legal heirs.

## Mandatory Steps Following a Death in Morocco

Before the distribution of assets can occur, several administrative and legal steps must be completed. Moroccan law is strict regarding the documentation of death and the verification of heirs.

### Reporting the Death and Vital Records
According to **Decree No. 36.21** regarding civil status, a death must be officially declared to the civil status officer. The declaration includes specific data about the deceased, their parents, and the person reporting the death. For Moroccans residing abroad, **Article 23** of the same decree specifies that the declaration must be made at Moroccan diplomatic missions or consulates based on a valid death certificate from the host country.

### Burial and Exhumation Regulations
In cases where a family wishes to move a body or manage a grave, **Decree No. 987.68** provides strict guidelines. To obtain permission for exhumation or transport, the head of the family or the person in charge of the funeral must provide:
*   A death certificate or identity document of the deceased.
*   A medical certificate proving the death was not caused by a contagious disease.
*   If the deceased is a foreigner being transported abroad, additional documentation regarding the destination and transport conditions is required.

## Foreigners and Inheritance in Morocco

A common question regarding **inheritance law Morocco help** involves the rights of foreigners. Under the **Moroccan Commercial Code (Article 15)**, a foreigner is considered to have full legal capacity to engage in trade and manage assets upon reaching 18 years of age, even if their national law sets a higher age.

However, when it comes to the actual distribution of real estate or bank accounts located in Morocco, the situation can be complex. If a foreigner dies leaving property in Morocco:
1.  **Immovable Property:** Generally, the law of the location of the property (Lex Rei Sitae) may apply, but Moroccan courts often refer back to the national law of the deceased for personal status matters.
2.  **Exequatur of Foreign Judgments:** If a foreign court issues an inheritance ruling, it must undergo a process called "Exequatur" to be enforceable in Morocco. **Article 430 of the Code of Civil Procedure** states that foreign judgments are not executed in Morocco unless they are endorsed with an executory formula by a Moroccan court, ensuring the judgment does not violate Moroccan public order (Ordre Public).

## Protecting the Rights of Grandchildren and Children

Moroccan law has evolved to provide better protection for vulnerable heirs. A significant update in the Moudawana concerns the "Mandatory Will" (Al-Wasiya al-Wajiba). 

Historically, if a son died before his father, the son's children (the grandchildren) might have been excluded from the grandfather's inheritance. Under the current **droit successoral Maroc**, grandchildren from both the son's and the daughter's side now have a right to a portion of the estate, equivalent to what their deceased parent would have inherited, within the limit of one-third of the total estate. This is a major pillar of **الإرث في القانون المغربي** designed to ensure social justice and the welfare of children.

### Child Custody and Financial Support
Inheritance often intersects with custody. Under **Decree No. 2.83.616**, family allowances and financial support are diverted to the person who has legal custody of the children. If a parent passes away, the Moudawana prioritizes the mother, then the father, then the maternal grandmother for custody, always acting in the "best interest of the child."
