# Simplifying Name Change

The Government Council recently approved Draft Law 16.25, amending the Civil Status Law to simplify the complex procedure of changing family names.

## What's New?
Previously, a decree from the Head of Government was required. The new law delegates part of these powers to local authorities for simple cases (material errors, "shameful" names).

## Accepted Reasons
- Name with "shameful" or offensive connotation.
- Foreign name that the holder wishes to "Moroccanize".
- Name subject to ridicule.

This law accompanies the digitization of civil status, soon allowing citizens to request these changes via a centralized portal.
