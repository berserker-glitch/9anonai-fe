# Digital Transformation of Justice

Digitalization is no longer an option but a necessity. The justice sector in Morocco is experiencing a digital revolution aimed at bringing justice closer to the citizen.

## Lawyer Platform & Electronic Exchange
Lawyers can now file petitions and pay judicial fees online without traveling. This saves considerable time.

## Remote Trials
Remote trials have been legalized and expanded, reducing the logistical burden of transporting detainees and speeding up the pace of hearings.

> **Note:** Despite technology, the human element and the guarantees of a fair trial remain the irreplaceable foundation.
